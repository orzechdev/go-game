# Go Game with Vue

## To do
- fix alpha-beta pruning for min-max algorithm, as it doesn't work correctly
- rewrite algorithms' code into code which operates on bits instead of arrays of integers - processor would operate on them much more faster
- implement [Monte-Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) ???
